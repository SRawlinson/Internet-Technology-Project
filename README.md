This project involved creating an web application using the Django framework we had been introduced to during the  'Tango with Django' project, 
also contained in a repository here. We created a social media site aimed at creative industry professionals and hobbyists called 'tbcscotland'
which allowed users to post and respond to ads on the site for services offered/needed, projects they were working on, or equipment they 
needed or were offering to hire. 

The project was completed in collaboration with James Brown, Monika Nizio, and Boris Wrabel.
